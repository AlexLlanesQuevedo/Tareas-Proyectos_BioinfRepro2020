# PhD project: "Lightening the Evolutionary History of Lowland Birds of the Tehuantepec Isthmus by Integrating Genomic, Ecological, and Biogeographic Information".

##### For approaching the historical processes that have determined the distribution of the lineages of lowland birds with no apparent physical barrier to genetic flow.
  
**Research questions:**
##### 1) Is there spatial and temporal congruence between the elements that have led to the diversification of lowland birds in Mexico in the IT?
##### 2) What is the current genetic dynamics of the contact areas between the populations of these species?

**Main objectives:**

##### 1) To estimate the genetic diversity of the populations of five species of lowland birds throughout their distribution areas, emphasizing their possible contact zones, with the use of molecular markers generated by next-generation sequencing.

##### 2) To determine the phylogeographic structure of the populations of six TI lowland bird species.

##### 3) To reconstruct the geographical history of the recovered genetic entities through ecological niche models projected into the past.

##### 4) To identify polymorphisms associated with candidate genes for local adaptation of the populations of the species to different environmental conditions

##### Six taxa distributed along the Isthmus of Tehuantepec with morphological and bioacustic divergence. For these species have been described several subspecies or morphotypes in the area of the TI. These species also represent phylogenetic and ecological diversity.

# The tangled evolutionary history of the Mesoamerican Velazquez Woodpecker complex (Centurus santacruzi, Aves: Picidae) revealed by using Next Generation Sequencing data

##### The Velazquez woodpecker *Centurus santacruzi* (Aves: Picidae) is a polytypic species distributed from the center-east regions of Mexico to North Nicaragua and Honduras islands. The ample morphological differentiation throughout its distribution has provoked the taxonomic recognition of several subspecies grouped in three main groups (*santacruzi*, *dubius* and *polygrammus*). Previous molecular studies have shown the close phylogenetic relationship of this complex with the Golden-fronted woopecker (*C. aurifrons*) and the Red-bellied woodpecker (*C. carolinus*); however, they fail to fully-resolve the evolutionary relationships among the subspecies. 

##### We employed Next Generation Sequencing methods (NextRAD) for analyzing the genetic diversity and structure within the morphotypes of the complex, and the correspondence of this variation with geography and ecology. We also inferred the phylogenetic relationships and hybridization among Velazquez, Golden-fronted, and Red-bellied woodpeckers by using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods.

##### We sampled and obtained Radseq sequences from 64 individuals of this species complex.

##### To explore spatial patterns of genetic structure in our study system we initially performed methods to infer clusters based on genetic similarity of each multilocus genotype: Principal Component Analysis and a Discriminant analysis  as implementd in packages SNPRelate v1.6.4 and “adegenet”, respectively.

##### To infer  the population structure and estimate individual admixture coefficients from the genotypic matrix we employed the LEA package  evaluating numbers of k from 1-6 with 20 repetitions of each one. The best number of populations (*K*) was inferred from the entropy criterion that evaluates the quality of fit of the statistical model to the data using a cross-validation technique

##### Phylogenetic analyses were performed by using Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) approaches with RAxML and MrBayes v3.2.5

##### For evaluating the extant and directionality of hybridization events among taxa we employed and compared three different approaches including Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference: Patterson’s D tests, Phylonet and TreeMix analyses.
